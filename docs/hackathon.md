Costume Contest: Build any app but show us a haunting user interface that’s polished and unforgettable. Bring in spooky design elements that enhance your app’s function.

#Criteria

Eligible submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor (the “Judges”). Judges may be employees of the sponsor or third parties, may or may not be listed individually on the Hackathon Website, and may change before or during the Judging Period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the sponsor.

Stage One) The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the ideas meet a baseline level of viability, in that the Project reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required APIs/SDKs featured in the Hackathon.

Stage Two) All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

Potential Value

Includes the extent to which the solution can be widely useful, easy to use, accessible, etc. Examples of considerations could include:

How unique or saturated the market is with these kinds of applications/solutions

Whether the UI is intuitive and brings the app functionality to the next level

If there is a clear need, extensibility, or other type of scalability of the Project


Implementation

Includes how well the idea is leveraging Kiro. Judges must understand how effectively Kiro was used to develop the project. Examples of effective usage include but are not limited to:

The variety of Kiro features/capabilities impactful in project development

The depth of understanding or benefit gained from a given Kiro feature/capability

The amount of experimentation and strategic decisions made in how Kiro features/capabilities are brought into the individual’s development workflow.




Quality and Design

Includes creativity, originality, and polished design of the project, such as:

Finding and using unique public resources like datasets

Solving a challenge in a unique way

Building in delightful UI experiences or other thoughtful choices
