Product Name: No Vibe – No Code
Version: MVP → Pre-Alpha → Alpha
Owner: [You]
Last Updated: 2025-11-05

1. 🧩 Overview
   1.1 Product Summary

No Vibe – No Code turns a product idea into an execution-ready backlog with AI-assisted documentation today, and layers in governed automation once Codex returns.

Current focus:

- **AI PM Agents** craft Idea Reviews, PRDs, and roadmaps under human supervision.
- **GitHub ticket export** publishes work into issues/projects for manual execution.

Upcoming focus:

- **Local VibeRunner automation** is ported after the MVP, keeping execution on the user’s machine and invoking Codex from the browser.
- Hosted or API-driven automation is deferred until Codex (or alternative LLM APIs) are production-ready.

Mission:
Help users go from “I have an idea” to “I have a governed plan with tickets” — and prepare the path to safe automation.

3. 🧱 Scope

**In Scope (MVP → Alpha)**

- Idea ingestion and evaluation (Idea Reviewer prompts, manual overrides).
- **Idea Panel**: Dedicated workspace for managing ideas with status tracking, notes, tags, and multiple analyses.
- PRD generation with templated structure and reviewer checklist.
- Roadmap and mind-map synthesis with artifact storage in `/vibeboard/`.
- GitHub issue and project board publishing based on approved roadmap.
- Manual execution tracking with human checkpoints between each AI output.
- Porting the existing local VibeRunner for optional automation once Codex returns.
- Lightweight marketing/showcase materials post-automation preview.

**Out of Scope (until Post-Alpha)**

- Hosted automation or remote execution.
- Non-GitHub integrations (Jira, Notion) beyond discovery.
- Paid tiers, billing systems, or enterprise compliance tooling.
- Direct AI API automation (Claude/GPT) during MVP.

5. 🚀 User Flow (Macro)

1️⃣ User captures an idea in the repo template or CLI prompt
↓
2️⃣ Idea Reviewer (via Codex-in-browser workflow) drafts an Idea Review for human edits
↓
3️⃣ Approved Idea Review seeds the PRD generator; reviewers confirm acceptance criteria
↓
4️⃣ Roadmap builder produces mind-map + milestone plan; humans reorder and tag checkpoints
↓
5️⃣ Ticket publisher creates GitHub issues/projects with “AI generated – pending review” labels
↓
6️⃣ (MVP) Humans run tickets manually, logging outcomes
↓
7️⃣ (Pre-Alpha) Ported VibeRunner can be triggered locally; every run stops for human QA and testing

6. 🧠 Functional Requirements

**6.1 Idea → PRD Module**

- Input: user prompt describing idea (README instructions or CLI script).
- Output: Idea Review + PRD `.md` files adhering to template fields.
- Execution: Operator triggers Codex-in-browser workflow; artifacts are committed with reviewer comments.
- Storage: `/vibeboard/docs/<slug>/` (idea.json, idea-review.md, prd.md) with version history.

**6.2 PRD → Mind-map → Roadmap Module**

- Transform PRD into mind-map JSON and milestone timeline.
- Embed human checkpoints (“Review with stakeholder”, “Manual feasibility check”) per milestone.
- Store outputs in `/vibeboard/docs/<slug>/roadmap.json` and `/vibeboard/docs/<slug>/mindmap.json`.

**6.3 Roadmap → Tickets Module**

- Each milestone generates a GitHub project item.
- Each deliverable yields an issue with acceptance criteria, dependencies, and explicit human test instructions.
- Tickets tagged `status/pending-review` until human marks ready.

**6.4 Execution Support (MVP)**

- Provide manual runbook steps within each ticket.
- Track completion state in `/vibeboard/issues/` JSON mirror.
- Surface a checklist for humans to confirm outcomes.

**6.5 Idea Panel (MVP)**

The Idea Panel is a dedicated workspace that transforms how users manage their ideas by separating the concept of an "idea" from its "analyses" (documents). This architectural change enables users to:

- **Centralized Idea Management**: View and manage all aspects of an idea in a single, dedicated full-screen workspace
- **Multiple Analyses per Idea**: Associate multiple analyses (startup analysis, hackathon analysis) with a single idea
- **Project Status Tracking**: Track ideas through their lifecycle (idea → in_progress → completed → archived)
- **Notes and Context**: Add and manage notes to capture thoughts, decisions, and progress over time
- **Organization with Tags**: Categorize and organize ideas using a flexible tagging system
- **Direct Analysis Creation**: Create new analyses directly from the panel without leaving the workspace
- **Source Tracking**: Distinguish between manually entered ideas and Doctor Frankenstein generated ideas
- **Responsive Design**: Full mobile and desktop support with touch-friendly interfaces
- **Future-Ready Architecture**: Foundation for future document types (PRDs, Design Docs, Roadmaps, Architecture Documents)

**Data Model:**

- New `ideas` table: Stores all ideas with panel management data (status, notes, tags)
- New `documents` table: Stores all analyses linked to ideas via foreign key
- Backward compatible: Existing `saved_analyses` table remains unchanged
- Clean separation: Ideas can exist without analyses (e.g., Doctor Frankenstein ideas awaiting evaluation)

**Key Features:**

- Breadcrumb navigation for easy return to dashboard
- Expandable/collapsible document sections for detailed analysis review
- Real-time status updates with last modified timestamps
- "Analyze" button with dropdown for selecting analysis type
- Accessibility-first design with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Feature flag controlled for gradual rollout

**6.6 Local Automation (Pre-Alpha)**

- Port prior VibeRunner CLI with isolation per repo.
- Allow manual selection of tickets; runner stops after code generation for human testing before pushing.
- Require explicit confirmation before git operations (commit, PR creation).

**6.7 Notifications & Logs**

- Record every AI generation and human approval in `/vibeboard/logs/`.
- Optional CLI notifications; Slack integration postponed until Alpha.

12. ✅ Acceptance Criteria

**MVP**

- User supplies an idea → receives Idea Review + PRD drafts within 24h.
- Roadmap and mind-map created with at least three milestones and human checkpoints.
- GitHub issues/projects generated with manual testing steps and status labels.
- Logs capture every AI generation with reviewer attribution.

**Pre-Alpha**

- Local VibeRunner port executes a single ticket using Codex-in-browser prompts.
- Runner requires human approval before writing commits or opening PRs.
- Manual QA checklist completed after each run.
- Documented rollback path for reverting automation output.

13. 📈 Future Vision

- Multi-model support (Claude, Gemini) once API automation is viable.
- CLI with API adapters to offload Codex-in-browser workflow.
- Hosted site where users link a repo and progress through human-in-the-loop automation.
- Optional integrations with Jira/Notion for ticket sync after Post-Alpha validation.

Summary

The MVP prioritises trustworthy documentation and backlog creation without automation dependencies. By sequencing the VibeRunner port after Codex returns—and requiring human checkpoints at every iteration—the product builds toward a marketable automation platform without sacrificing safety or transparency.
