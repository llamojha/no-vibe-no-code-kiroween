# Product Overview

**No Vibe No Code** is an AI-powered product management platform that transforms raw startup ideas into execution-ready documentation and GitHub backlogs.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Rapid Validation**: Transform raw startup ideas into comprehensive analyses with actionable insights in minutes
- **AI-Assisted Documentation**: Generate professional project documentation (PRDs, technical designs, roadmaps) with human oversight
- **Execution-Ready Output**: Bridge the gap between ideation and implementation with structured, exportable documentation
- **Quality Assurance**: Property-based testing framework ensures system correctness and reliability across all features

## Key Features

### Core Analysis Tools

- **Idea Analysis**: AI-powered startup idea evaluation and scoring with detailed criteria breakdown
- **Hackathon Analyzer**: Specialized tool for hackathon project evaluation with category-specific scoring (Kiroween theme)
- **Doctor Frankenstein**: AI-powered mashup idea generator combining technologies from tech companies or AWS services with interactive slot machine interface

### Project Management

- **Idea Panel** (In Development): Transform saved analyses into execution-ready documentation (PRDs, Technical Design, Roadmaps, Architecture Documents)
- **Dashboard**: Unified view of all analyses with filtering, search, and management capabilities
- **Analysis History**: Track and manage all generated analyses with version history

### Export & Integration

- **Multi-format Export**: Export analyses as PDF, Markdown, or JSON
- **GitHub Integration** (Planned): Export analysis results as GitHub issues and project boards

### Platform Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Full English and Spanish localization
- **Credit System**: Usage-based credit system with tier-based limits (free, paid, admin)
- **Analytics Integration**: Comprehensive PostHog analytics tracking for product insights
- **Mock Mode**: Development and testing mode without consuming API credits

## Product Evolution & Strategy

### Strategic Shifts

The product has evolved from a pure "idea-to-backlog" automation tool to a more comprehensive **AI-assisted product management platform** with the following strategic adjustments:

1. **Immediate Value Focus**: Shifted from waiting for Codex API to delivering immediate value through analysis and documentation generation using Google Gemini AI

2. **Human-in-the-Loop Emphasis**: Strengthened the human oversight model with:

   - Credit system to manage usage and prevent abuse
   - Multi-tier access (free, paid, admin) for different user needs
   - Comprehensive analytics to understand user behavior

3. **Developer Experience Priority**: Added robust development infrastructure:

   - Mock mode for cost-free development and testing
   - Property-based testing for system correctness
   - Hexagonal architecture for maintainability and extensibility

4. **Feature Diversification**: Expanded beyond core analysis:
   - Doctor Frankenstein for creative ideation
   - Hackathon-specific evaluation tools
   - Multi-format export capabilities

### Current Product Strategy

**Short-term (3-6 months)**:

- Complete Idea Panel for end-to-end documentation generation
- Enhance export and sharing capabilities
- Improve dashboard and analysis management
- Expand language support beyond English/Spanish

**Medium-term (6-12 months)**:

- GitHub integration for seamless workflow
- Collaborative features for team usage
- Template system for custom workflows
- API access for programmatic integration

**Long-term (12+ months)**:

- Local automation with VibeRunner (pending Codex availability)
- Hosted team solutions with advanced collaboration
- Enterprise features (SSO, compliance, audit logs)
- Multi-model AI support for flexibility

### Competitive Positioning

**Differentiators**:

- Specialized for product ideation and documentation (not general-purpose)
- Human oversight built into every workflow
- Property-based testing ensures reliability
- Multi-language support from day one
- Transparent credit system with fair pricing

**Market Position**: Premium AI-assisted product management tool for serious builders who value quality, transparency, and control over pure automation.
